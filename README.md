## Notes:

* The environment was set up using Unity
* I take credit for all assets, except the moon texture and stone prefabs.
* Movement and projectile code for player 1 and 2 is credited to tutorials with modifications, the rest was my own.
* My goal is to create a enjoyable and creative hide and seek 1v1 game.
* The gears are collectables
